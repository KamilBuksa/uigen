Stage and commit all changes.

Do the following:

1. Run `git status` to see all modified and untracked files
2. Run `git diff` to review staged and unstaged changes
3. Run `git log -5 --oneline` to see recent commit message style
4. Stage all relevant files (excluding secrets)
5. Create a commit with a concise message that:
   - Summarizes the nature of changes (add/update/fix/refactor)
   - Focuses on "why" rather than "what"
   - Follows the repository's commit style
   - Does NOT include Claude Code footer or co-author attribution

Do NOT push unless explicitly requested.
